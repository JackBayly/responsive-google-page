A copy of Google's Home Page, created to practice HTML and CSS skills.
<p>Here's a live demo: https://jackbayly.github.io/responsive-google-page/ </p>
<h2>Things Learned</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Google Fonts</li>
 <li>Google Icons</li>
 <li>Media queries</li>
 <li>Organizing parts of a webpage</li>
 <li>hover and focus in CSS</li>
 <li>Flexbox</li>
</ul>
<h2>Things to Note</h2>
<ul>
 <li>The text is in Spanish, as I had my browser set to the language on my browser. I kept it the same in the project.</li>
 <li>The page doesn't function like google. I was just practicing HTML and CSS to get it to look like Google.</li>
 <li>It's a copy of how Google looked on my old laptop and may not be how Google looks on other browsers/devices.</li> 
 <li>RIP my old laptop</li>
 </ul>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The first draft of this project was pretty straightforward. I wanted to make a copy of the Google homepage by just looking at it, with HTML and CSS. I did that fairly quickly. The hard part was getting it to be responsive in the final draft, as it was my first time making a webpage responsive for mobile devices. After a lot of googling, I found media queries, and they saved the day. I like the result. It looks like Google on large devices and on phones. Mission accomplished.</p>
